# Future Work

* I will fix some error, like when you input the wrong file name it should just tells you the file does not exist instead let you put in the target and progress and then tells you the file does not exist.
* I will make it better I think, I was thinking about make it into some kind of online chat software and it can store the chat history when you leave.
